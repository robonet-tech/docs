# Marketplace Adapter Framework

## What is a marketplace adapter?
Adapters standardize trading logic and order types across different types of on-chain exchanges. They enable standardized order 
placement and data fetching calls from the perspective of the market-making strategy contract.

Each adapter is customized for a particular exchange's idiosyncrasies to allow this level of standardization. Every adapter smart contract must inherit from 
`IBaseMarketplaceAdapter.sol` and must inherit a set of predefined functions, each with its intended purpose of use from the
 perspective of the strategy.
