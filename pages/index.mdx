# Background
 
DeFi vaults are a crucial component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, facilitating various financial activities including automating yield generation and rebalancing processes to optimize returns for users. 
By dynamically shifting capital as new opportunities arise, DeFi vaults allow users to passively invest without needing in-depth knowledge of the underlying protocols or decentralized finance mechanisms.

## Function of Robonet
Robonet offers a variety of vaults where users can deposit ERC-20 tokens to automate yield-generating strategies. These vaults utilize **decentralized AI agents** to capture pricing inefficiencies and generate yield, allowing Robonet to provide risk management strategies without the need for active user involvement.

## Key Terms

**ERC-20 Tokens**: A standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures that tokens are compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

**Liquidity Pool**: A collection of funds locked in a smart contract used to facilitate trading and lending on decentralized platforms.

**Yield Generation**: The process of earning returns on investments, often through interest or other financial mechanisms in DeFi protocols.

**Decentralized AI Agents**: Autonomous software programs that use artificial intelligence to execute smart contract functions on behalf of users, optimizing performance and decision-making without human intervention.

**Vault Managers**: Decentralized AI Agents that perform yield generation strategies on behalf of users who deposit ERC-20 tokens into designated [agent vaults](learn/what#how-agent-vaults-work).
