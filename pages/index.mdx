# Overview
 
DeFi vaults are a crucial component of the decentralized finance ecosystem, facilitating various financial activities including automating yield generation and rebalancing processes to optimize returns for users. 
By dynamically shifting capital as new opportunities arise, DeFi vaults allow users to passively invest without needing in-depth knowledge of the underlying protocols or decentralized finance mechanisms.

## Introducing Robonet
Robonet offers a variety of vaults where users can deposit ERC-20 tokens to automate yield-generating strategies. These vaults utilize decentralized AI agents to capture pricing inefficiencies and generate yield. Robonet's advanced AI and decentralized technology ensure optimal performance and risk management without the need for active user involvement.

## Key Terms
