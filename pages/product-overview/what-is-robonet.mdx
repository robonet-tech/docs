# What is RoboNet?

### **What is Robonet?**

Robonet is the operating system for capital. It lets you describe financial strategies in plain English, backtest them against real market data, and deploy as immutable strategies via onchain agents that execute autonomously across DeFi. Unlike copy-trading where you follow someone else's signals, strategy marketplaces where execution is your problem, or asset managers who take custody of your assets.

Robonet compiles your ideas into verified, auditable strategy code that you own. No coding required. No custody transferred. No post-deployment tampering. You retain your funds, you own your IP, and every trade executed is transparently accounted onchain. 

### **The Robonet Mental Model**

Five abstractions define how Robonet works, each building on the last to take you from idea to autonomous execution:

- **Intent** is your trading idea in plain language: "buy ETH when momentum is strong," "capture funding rates while staying delta-neutral."
- **Strategy** is that trading idea compiled into structured logic – entry conditions, exit conditions, position sizing, risk parameters, indicator configuration – complete code you own.
- **Agent** is a strategy deployed on-chain; once live, the strategy cannot be modified, so what you optimized is exactly what runs. Agents continuously evaluate present market conditions and make decisions guarded by immutable strategy code.
- **Vault** is the onchain primitive holding capital allocated to an agent, either private (your capital only) or public (pooled capital where creators can charge performance fees).
- **Capital** is non-custodial – you choose where to deposit, Robonet never holds your funds, and allocation follows verified onchain records.

### **Why Robonet Exists**

Existing DeFi trading tools force a tradeoff: either you're technical enough to code, deploy, and monitor your own strategies 24/7, or you hand custody to an asset manager and hope their interests align with yours. Copy-trading makes you reactive – always following, never owning. Strategy marketplaces give you ideas but leave execution as your problem. 

Robonet exists because capital deserves infrastructure that lets anyone with an idea express it, test it, own it, and deploy it – without writing code, surrendering custody, or trusting black boxes.
