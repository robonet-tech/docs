# Fees

## Liquidity Provider (LP) Fees
The vault creator sets LP fees at the time of vault creation. Vault managers can also later update the LP fee percentage. The maximum permissible LP fee is 10%. This fee is paid directly to liquidity providers when they act as the counterparty in buying or selling an NFT during a trade. 

The fee is paid within the vault and added to an LP's liquidity position. Liquidity Providers can withdraw this fee by calling `pullLiquidity` when they withdraw their liquidity position.

## Admin Fees
Vault creators set admin fees at the time of vault creation. Vault managers can later update the admin fee percentage. The maximum permissible admin fee is 10%. This fee is paid to an `adminRecipient` address set by the admin on every trade with that specific vault.

## Protocol Fees
The Robonet protocol is currently free to use.
