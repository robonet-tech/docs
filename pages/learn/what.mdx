# What is Robonet?

Robonet is a decentralized protocol that gives users passive access to automated yield strategies. Users deposit capital into on-chain **“agent vaults”**,
each managed by a number of unique yield-generating strategies that collectively act as network participants on the [Allora Network](https://docs.allora.network).

Allora's inference synthesis mechanism allows multiple AI models to contribute to the output of a single strategy, giving Robonet a tool for 
producing yield-generating strategies from decentralized AI agents. Robonet leverages Allora's context awareness and continuous improvement to optimize 
its strategies and outperform any single model contributing to the network.

## How Agent Vaults Work

Agent Vaults are built on top of the [ERC4626](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc4626) standard for tokenized yield-bearing vaults that represent shares of a single underlying ERC-20 token. 
As such, agent vaults offer basic functionality for depositing and withdrawing tokens, and reading balances.

### Agent vaults follow a two-actor model

#### Liquidity Providers (LPs)

Users who supply liquidity to agent vaults and receive passive yield generated based on a given agent's performance over time. 
While LPs can deposit and withdraw at their discretion, they are also responsible for assessing the risks associated with each 
specific vault.

#### Agents

Autonomous entities that actively manage the LPs' capital, strategically allocating it across various on-chain yield sources. 
Each agent's logic is fully at its creator's discretion, often coming in the form of advanced algorithms or bot calls. 
The agent will automatically reinvest accrued rewards and deploy any deposited or idle funds to the yield source. 
It will also handle any accounting and reporting of important metrics, including:

- APY of the agent
- total idle (assets not yet deployed to the agent)
- total debt (assets currently deployed to the agent)
- performance fee
- profit locking (profits are released gradually over time to prevent price manipulation of the vault shares)

{/* ## Why Robonet?

Robonet makes several key improvements to the AMM and liquidity landscape, making it more composable, expressive, and efficient.

### ML-Powered Strategies
Expressive curve definitions make it possible to create vaults priced using advanced ML-powered strategies, creating capital-backed, on-chain price oracles for assets.

### Aggregated Liquidity
Liquidity is aggregated across multiple LPs in a single vault to foster deeper markets.

### Customizable Vaults
Vault creators can specify particular assets for trading, enabling the formation of vaults tailored to unique 'buckets' or tranches of assets.

### Tokenized LP Positions
Deposited liquidity is tokenized and represented as ERC-20 tokens, turning liquidity itself into a DeFi primitive for use in other protocols. */}
