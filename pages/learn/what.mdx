# What is Robonet?

RoboNet is a DeFi-optimized, decentralized yield protocol that gives users passive access to automated, machine-powered yield strategies. Users deposit capital into on-chain “vaults”, 
each managed by specific machine-powered strategies running on the [Allora Network](https://docs.allora.network).

RoboNet will be released in several phases. The current release of the protocol has vaults specific to market-making strategies in prediction markets and ERC-20 tokens. RoboNet's end state will enable complex, multi-asset strategies.

## How Robonet Works

With Robonet, liquidity providers can deposit ERC-20 tokens into liquidity vaults and receive a Liquidity Pool (LP) position. LP Positions represent ownership of the deposited 
liquidity and can be traded or farmed to earn additional ERC-20 tokens. RoboNet paves the way for liquidity to become a fundamental building block for DeFi primitives and protocols.

When users want to trade a token, they can select from various vaults in RoboNet and trade it the same way as any other token pair. The price of the token is determined by the logic specified in 
the vault's curve. RoboNet's curve definition is incredibly versatile, enabling vaults that have linear slippage to vaults with curves defined by ML-powered appraisals. By providing 
liquidity to traders, liquidity providers earn fees and contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency of the market.

## Why Robonet?

RoboNet makes several key improvements to the AMM and liquidity landscape, making it more composable, expressive, and efficient.

### ML-Powered Strategies
Expressive curve definitions make it possible to create vaults priced using advanced ML-powered strategies, creating capital-backed, on-chain price oracles for assets.

### Aggregated Liquidity
Liquidity is aggregated across multiple LPs in a single vault to foster deeper markets.

### Customizable Vaults
Vault creators can specify particular assets for trading, enabling the formation of vaults tailored to unique 'buckets' or tranches of assets.

### Tokenized LP Positions
Deposited liquidity is tokenized and represented as ERC-20 tokens, turning liquidity itself into a DeFi primitive for use in other DeFi primitives and protocols.
