# Point System

Our point system is designed to reward users participating in our incentivized pools. Here's a brief overview:

- Daily Calculation: Points are calculated daily through an automated process.
- Seasonal Structure: Points are allocated within defined Seasons, each having specific start and end dates.

This system aims to foster active participation and fair distribution of rewards in our ecosystem.
