# Point System

Every day, the system calculates and distributes points to users based on their activity in the vaults. Points are like rewards for participating in the system.

## How It Works

### Season Check

The system first checks what the current season is. Think of a season like a period during which points are being tracked and given out.

### Calculate Daily Points

The system checks how much each user had in their vaults at the beginning of the day.
It then looks at all the deposits (adding money) and withdrawals (taking money out) each user made during the day.

### Calculate Time-Weighted Balance:
It calculates the average amount each user had in their vaults over the day, giving more weight to balances that were held longer.
For example, if you kept money in the vault for the whole day, you get more points than if you only kept it there for a few hours.
Based on this average balance, the system distributes a set amount of points to users. 
Each vault has a specific budget of points to give out daily, starting at 1000 points per day.
After calculating the points, the system updates each user's points balance in the database.

### Leaderboard Update
Finally, the system updates the leaderboard.
This shows who has the most points, similar to a high score list in a game.
